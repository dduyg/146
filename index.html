        <h1>Understanding Recursion</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>What is Recursion?</h2>
        <p>Recursion is a method of solving problems where a function calls itself as a subroutine. This allows the function to be repeated several times, as it can call itself during its execution.</p>

        <h2>Key Components of Recursion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Case</strong>: This is the condition under which the recursion ends. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: This is the part of the function where the recursion happens. The function calls itself with a different set of parameters, moving closer to the base case with each call.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Recursion Works</h2>
        <p>Imagine you want to solve a problem that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems. Recursion simplifies the solution by having the function handle the small problems itself.</p>

        <h2>Example: Factorial Function</h2>
        <p>The factorial of a number \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). For example, \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \).</p>
        <p>A recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number could look like this:</p>

        <pre><code>def factorial(n):
    # Base case
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)</code></pre>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p><strong>Initial Call</strong>: <code>factorial(5)</code></p>
        <p>Since <code>5</code> is neither <code>0</code> nor <code>1</code>, it goes to the recursive case: <code>5 * factorial(4)</code></p>

        <p><strong>Next Call</strong>: <code>factorial(4)</code></p>
        <p>Again, <code>4</code> is neither <code>0</code> nor <code>1</code>, so it recurses: <code>4 * factorial(3)</code></p>

        <p><strong>Continued Calls</strong>: This process continues until <code>factorial(1)</code> is reached.</p>

        <p><strong>Base Case Reached</strong>: <code>factorial(1)</code></p>
        <p>This returns <code>1</code>, as it matches the base case condition.</p>

        <p><strong>Unwinding the Stack</strong>:</p>
        <p>The return value <code>1</code> from <code>factorial(1)</code> is multiplied by <code>2</code> in the previous call (<code>factorial(2)</code>), resulting in <code>2</code>.</p>
        <p>This <code>2</code> is multiplied by <code>3</code> in the call before that (<code>factorial(3)</code>), and so on.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the original call <code>factorial(5)</code> resolves to <code>5 * 24 = 120</code>.</p>

        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion</h2>
        <p><strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplifies code for problems that can naturally be divided into similar subproblems (e.g., tree traversals, sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can lead to high memory usage due to deep recursion (stack overflow).</li>
            <li>Might be less efficient in terms of time and space compared to iterative solutions for some problems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Recursion is a powerful concept but must be used judiciously, keeping in mind the problem's nature and the potential overhead in terms of performance.</p>
